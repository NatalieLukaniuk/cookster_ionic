## TODO

- Desktop: main page with recipies. At screens with width > 1600px ion-infinite-scroll works incorrectly, there is large blank gap visible before the next portion of content is loaded
- All: add products to shopping list for selected dates. When new product is added to shopping list, page is scrolled to the top
